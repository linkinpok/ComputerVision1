We guess that we have problem with the implementation of function
computehomographydistance(), since the minimal calculated distance
is larger than 25000. In this case we have to set threshold to
80000 to obtain some inliers.
The consistency with multiple runs is not garateed. We think that
it depends on the limited functionality of rand(), which is used in
picksample().
