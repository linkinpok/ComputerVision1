0. improving computeDisparityEff
We suggest two solutions for improving performance of computing disparity

Solution 1: store costs of search range of each image row to reuse for next row
76.890584 seconds (712.82 M allocations: 50.923 GiB, 7.88% gc time)
disparity_SSD_eff error = 0.057873

Solution 2: scan window by a larger step than 1 pixel to reduce the computational time and allocations
- e.g. sliding window by 2-pixel-step:
32.526081 seconds (180.37 M allocations: 25.946 GiB, 8.38% gc time)
disparity_SSD_eff error = 0.059053
- e.g. sliding window by 5-pixel-step:
12.472429 seconds (74.59 M allocations: 10.774 GiB, 8.82% gc time)
disparity_SSD_eff error = 0.065590


1. Varying window size
- 5x5 window:
SSD = 40.614900 seconds (356.58 M allocations: 51.227 GiB, 9.45% gc time)
NC = 52.130384 seconds (445.61 M allocations: 81.741 GiB, 10.11% gc time)
disparity_SSD error = 0.057665
disparity_NC error = 0.081509

- 11x11 window:
SSD = 77.974064 seconds (349.05 M allocations: 142.012 GiB, 12.36% gc time)
NC = 127.755755 seconds (436.19 M allocations: 232.915 GiB, 11.89% gc time)
disparity_SSD error = 0.053865
disparity_NC error = 0.063575

- 15x15 window:
SSD = 102.952019 seconds (344.05 M allocations: 253.654 GiB, 14.66% gc time)
NC = 181.876117 seconds (429.95 M allocations: 418.779 GiB, 12.74% gc time)
disparity_SSD error = 0.054452
disparity_NC error = 0.061038

- 21x21 window:
SSD = 205.385762 seconds (336.61 M allocations: 446.093 GiB, 21.63% gc time)
NC = 389.526953 seconds (420.65 M allocations: 739.144 GiB, 18.55% gc time)
disparity_SSD error = 0.057383
disparity_NC error = 0.060355

- 27x27 window:
SSD = 192.767036 seconds (329.23 M allocations: 701.794 GiB, 23.31% gc time)
NC = 410.777194 seconds (411.43 M allocations: 1.138 TiB, 18.06% gc time)
disparity_SSD error = 0.061102
disparity_NC error = 0.062735

The lowest average EPE can be obtained by window size of 11x11 for SSD cost function
and 21x21 for NC cost function


2. Using a bigger window
Pros:
- each window contains more information for computing disparity
- the depth map is smoother and contains less noise

Cons:
- high computational cost in time and memory allocations
