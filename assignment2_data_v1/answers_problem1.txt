1.7.
    There is no difference between the top level of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids,
    because the difference gets smaller along the upper levels and can be approximated
    to be zero at the highest level.

1.8.
    A good sharpened image can be reconstructed by scaling up the finest two levels
    of the Laplacian pyramid both by factor 1.5, which is great enough to gain
    a good sharpeness but not to amplify much noise.
